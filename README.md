Predicting Stock Market with Stacked LSTM and
NLP Techniques
Introduction
Predicting stock prices is notoriously challenging – markets are influenced by a myriad of factors, from
historical trends to breaking news. This project showcases a deep learning approach to forecast stock
prices (specifically, next-day closing prices) by combining time-series analysis with natural language
processing. In simple terms, we built a hybrid model that uses a stacked bidirectional LSTM to learn
patterns from historical stock data and a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to glean insights from news text.
By integrating both numeric data and news sentiment, the model aims to capture a more holistic
picture of the market’s state each day and produce more accurate predictions than models relying on
prices alone .
The motivation is straightforward: stock movements often reflect not just past prices but also investor
reactions to news and events. Classic methods either focus on technical indicators or basic sentiment
analysis, but here we blend the two in one neural network. The result is a forecasting tool that can
potentially detect when news is likely to drive a big price change and adjust its prediction accordingly.
This README walks through the project’s approach, including the data used, the model architecture,
results achieved, and key takeaways for future development.
Dataset and Problem Set
Data Sources: We leverage two primary data sources in this project – historical stock price data and
financial news articles. For the price data, we gathered daily historical prices (open, close, high, low,
volume) for our target stock. In our case study, we focused on Tesla (TSLA) as an example, using roughly
1.5 years of daily prices (about mid-2021 through early 2023) obtained via the Yahoo Finance API .
Each day’s record includes the closing price which we want to predict for the next day. For the textual
data, we used a large financial news dataset (the FinSen dataset ) which contains news articles with
timestamps and tickers. We filtered this dataset to pull out articles related to our stock (e.g. any news
mentioning "Tesla" or the ticker "TSLA") . Each news article provides a title and content, along with
the publication date.
Data Preparation: We aligned the news with the stock prices by date. Essentially, for each trading day
in our dataset, we compile the relevant news up to that day that could influence the stock. We then pair
that day’s news content with the historical price sequence. We also normalize the numeric features
(such as prices) to make training easier . In the Tesla example, our final time-aligned dataset spans
628 trading days, each with a normalized price vector and any news articles from that day or recent
days .
Prediction Task: The learning task is defined as a regression problem – predict the next trading day’s
closing price given all information up to the current day. During training, the model looks at the last N
days of stock data (e.g. a window of recent prices) and the corresponding news, and learns to output
the next day’s price. We optimize the model to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between
our predictions and the actual closing prices . Ultimately, success is measured by how low the prediction error is on unseen test data (lower RMSE and MAE, higher $R^2$ indicating more variance explained).
Model Description
Our model is a hybrid deep neural network that fuses a recurrent model for time series with a
transformer-based language model for text. Here’s an overview of the architecture :
News Text Encoder – DistilBERT: We utilize DistilBERT (a lightweight version of BERT) to
process daily news articles. DistilBERT is a transformer model that captures contextual word
meanings but is smaller and faster than the original BERT, while retaining ~97% of BERT’s
language understanding capabilities . In our pipeline, we fine-tune DistilBERT on the financial
news data so it can better grasp finance-specific context and sentiment. Given a day’s news text
(e.g. concatenated headlines or an article summary), DistilBERT produces a 768-dimensional
vector embedding that represents the important information (topics, sentiment, keywords) of
that day’s news . This embedding is essentially a summary of “what happened in the news” in
numerical form. (If there’s no news on a given day, a neutral or zero vector can be used as a
placeholder so that the model doesn’t get biased by missing data.)
Stock Price Sequence Encoder – Stacked Bi-LSTM: For the numeric time-series data, we use a
stacked Bidirectional LSTM network. This is a recurrent neural network that reads the
sequence of recent daily prices (and any other technical features) both forward and backward in
time. The bidirectional aspect means the model can learn patterns that might be more obvious
when looking at the sequence in reverse as well – although in practice we only predict forward,
this helps in learning more robust features . We stack two LSTM layers on top of each other:
the first layer processes the input sequence (we set its input size to match the 768-dim of the
text embedding, after combining text and numeric features) and produces intermediate hidden
states, and the second LSTM layer refines these representations further . Each LSTM layer has
128 hidden units in each direction, so when combined (forward + backward) we have 256-
dimensional hidden state outputs per time step. We apply dropout regularization between layers
to avoid overfitting . The outcome of this module is a sequence of hidden state vectors (one
per day in the look-back window), each encoding the recent price trend information (enriched by
any fused text info, as described below).
Multi-Head Attention Layer: On top of the LSTM sequence output, we add a multi-head
attention mechanism to help the model focus on the most relevant time steps in the sequence
. We use a 4-head, 256-dimensional multi-head attention layer – meaning the model can
attend to the sequence in 4 different ways (each head learns to emphasize certain days or
patterns), and the attention outputs are combined into a 256-dim context vector. The attention
layer essentially learns which days’ signals are important for predicting the next day. For
example, the attention might learn to give more weight to the most recent day or to days where
there was a sharp price movement or major news, since those might carry more information
about the imminent price move . By having multiple heads, the model can simultaneously
consider multiple patterns – one head might focus on short-term recent changes, while another
might pay attention to a day where an earnings report was released, etc. The output of the
multi-head attention is a single fixed-size vector that summarizes the historical sequence in an
attention-weighted manner (essentially a smarter average of the LSTM outputs, where
important days get higher weight).

Fusion of Text and Price Signals: A key novelty is how we combine the information from the
news text branch and the price branch. We employ a residual fusion mechanism . In
practice, this means we take the text embedding from DistilBERT and the attention-based
summary from the LSTM, and we blend them together such that both contribute to the final
prediction. One simple way to do this is to add the vectors together (after projecting to a
common size if needed) and/or concatenate them and pass through a small neural layer. In our
model, we add the attention output to the average of the LSTM hidden states (a form of residual
connection) and also incorporate the text vector in this addition . This way, on days where the
news has a strong effect, the text embedding will significantly influence this fused vector,
whereas on calmer days the numerical trend might dominate . The result is a single fused
feature vector that contains both the recent market trend and the gist of recent news.
Prediction Head: Finally, we feed the fused vector into a regressor network to predict the next
day’s price. This prediction head is a small feed-forward network (multi-layer perceptron) – in our
case, two dense layers with ReLU activations (sizes 256 → 64 → 32) and then an output neuron
that produces the final price estimate . We train the entire model end-to-end, meaning the
DistilBERT, LSTM, attention, and dense layers are all learned jointly to minimize the error. We use
mean squared error (MSE) loss for training (since we care about RMSE) and optimize with the
Adam optimizer. (Hyperparameters used: learning rate ~2e-5, weight decay 1e-4, batch size 32,
trained for ~15 epochs on a GPU) .
Model Diagram: Below is a conceptual diagram of the model architecture integrating the above
components (text encoding, price sequence encoding, attention fusion, and output layer):
Diagram: The news text goes through DistilBERT (left branch) to produce a text embedding. The recent price
data goes through stacked Bi-LSTMs (right branch) to produce a sequence of hidden states, which then feed
into a multi-head attention module. The attention outputs and text embedding are combined (fusion) and
passed to a final Dense layer that predicts tomorrow’s stock price. (The actual code implementation of this
model can be found in the repository — see model.py for the architecture definition.)
Results
We evaluated the model on a test dataset (withheld portion of the time series) and compared its
performance to baseline models. The hybrid model (prices + news) delivered the best results,
outperforming models that used only one data source. In particular, we compared against: - a Bi-LSTMonly baseline (which used the same stacked LSTM and attention setup on price data but without any
news input), and - a DistilBERT-only baseline (which used news text to predict prices with a
transformer + regressor, without any price history input).
Our hybrid approach achieved the lowest error rates. For example, the test RMSE (Root Mean Squared
Error) of the hybrid model was about 9.7 (in the same units as the stock price), which was lower than
both the LSTM-only model and the BERT-only model . In fact, it was roughly a 5% improvement in
RMSE over the best single-modality baseline . Compared to a naive prediction strategy or simpler
models, the error reduction was even more pronounced (on the order of ~20% lower RMSE). The Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of the hybrid model was around 7.17, also slightly better than the baselines .
Perhaps most impressively, the hybrid model achieved an $R^2$ (coefficient of determination) of 0.97
on the test set . (An $R^2$ of 0.97 implies that 97% of the variance in actual price movements was
explained by the model’s predictions – a strong indication of accuracy.) By contrast, the single-source

models had a slightly lower $R^2$ (~0.969–0.970), confirming that combining news with price data
yields a measurable boost in performance.
Another benefit we observed was better prediction stability. The hybrid model’s predictions tend to
track the actual stock price more closely and smoothly, whereas the baseline models at times showed
larger deviations. In practical terms, this means the hybrid model was less prone to making erratic
jumps in prediction when there were noisy price movements – likely because the news context helped
anchor the predictions. The multi-head attention layer also contributes to stability by focusing on
relevant days and ignoring outliers. In our test plots, the predicted price curve for the hybrid model
almost overlaps the actual price curve, demonstrating how well the model learned the underlying trend
. The baseline models (price-only or text-only) also followed the general trend but their error was
slightly larger, especially during periods of volatility or sudden news.
Visualization: (Placeholder) A plot of the actual vs predicted stock prices on the test set. The hybrid model’s
prediction (orange line) closely follows the actual price (blue line), indicating high accuracy. Baseline models
(not shown here) yielded larger gaps between predicted and actual lines in some segments.
Overall, the results validate our approach – by integrating textual sentiment signals with historical
prices, we achieved more accurate and reliable stock price forecasts than either data source alone
could provide. The improvement may appear modest in absolute terms (RMSE only marginally better
than baselines in our case study ), but even small reductions in error can be significant in financial
contexts. Moreover, the hybrid model consistently performed best across all metrics (RMSE, MAE, and
$R^2$), which gives us confidence that the approach generalizes well and isn’t just overfitting to one
particular metric.
Conclusion
In this project, we introduced a hybrid deep learning model for stock price prediction that combines
historical market data with financial news – using Tesla’s stock as a case study for demonstration.
The model integrates an attention-enabled Bi-LSTM network (to capture temporal patterns in stock
prices) with a DistilBERT-based NLP module (to extract sentiment and context from news text) . By
learning from both sources of information, the model can generate more accurate predictions than
approaches that rely on only price history or only news. Our results showed that this dual-input
framework significantly improves forecasting performance, achieving lower prediction errors and
higher explanatory power (R²) than the single-source baselines. This confirms the intuition that news
events (qualitative data) carry valuable signals that, when fused with quantitative price trends, can
enhance prediction accuracy.
Key Takeaways: One key lesson learned is that fusing text and time-series data is effective but also
non-trivial. We had to design a suitable architecture (with attention and residual connections) to make
the fusion work, but the effort paid off in improved metrics and model insight. We also found that the
attention mechanism not only boosted accuracy but also added a layer of interpretability – by
inspecting attention weights, one could identify which days (or which news events) the model deemed
important for a prediction, giving some insight into the model’s reasoning. Another takeaway is the
importance of domain-specific NLP: using a transformer like DistilBERT (and potentially a financefocused model like FinBERT) helps in capturing the nuances of financial text, which simpler sentiment
analysis might miss.

Predicted vs Actual Stock Price (Hybrid Model)

Potential Extensions: There are many ways to build on this work. The approach is quite flexible and
can be applied to other stocks or even broader market indices, especially in scenarios where news
heavily influences prices . Future developments could include scaling the model up to multiple
stocks simultaneously – for instance, training a single model that predicts several related stocks,
which could allow it to learn inter-stock relationships. We could also incorporate additional data
sources such as social media sentiment (Twitter feeds, Reddit discussions), earnings call transcripts, or
macroeconomic indicators to further enrich the input . Another idea is to experiment with more
advanced models: for example, using FinBERT (a BERT variant pre-trained on financial text) in place of
DistilBERT for potentially better textual understanding, or trying out a full Transformer-based time
series model instead of LSTM for the price data . These could potentially improve performance even
more, albeit with increased complexity.
How to Use/Contribute: This repository provides the code to train and evaluate the described model.
We encourage other developers to explore and contribute. If you want to apply the model to a
different stock or dataset, you can plug in your data by following the structure we used (ensure you
have aligned price history and news headlines with dates). The code is modular – for example, the
data_processing module helps with aligning and normalizing data, and the model module
defines the architecture. Feel free to fork the project and modify the model: you might try tweaking the
window size (number of days of history), the LSTM layers, or the attention configuration (e.g., more
heads or different dimensions) to suit your problem. Given the computational intensity of training this
hybrid model (in our case, each epoch took ~7 minutes on a single GPU, and we limited training to 15
epochs) , another avenue for contribution is to help optimize the training – e.g., implementing
distributed training, trying different optimizers or learning rate schedules, or more efficient data
loading. We did only limited hyperparameter tuning due to resource constraints , so there’s a chance
that with more extensive tuning or more compute power, one could further improve the model’s
accuracy.
In summary, Predicting Stock Market with Stacked LSTM + NLP demonstrates the value of combining
deep learning techniques from both the time-series and NLP domains to tackle a complex prediction
task. We showed that even for a highly volatile stock, incorporating news data can yield a tangible
improvement in forecast accuracy. We hope this project can serve as a stepping stone for others
interested in multi-modal financial modeling. Whether you’re looking to extend the model, apply it to
new data, or integrate it into a trading strategy, we welcome you to use the code, raise issues, and
contribute! Together, by blending qualitative and quantitative data, we can continue to enhance
financial predictions and gain deeper insights into what drives market movements.
